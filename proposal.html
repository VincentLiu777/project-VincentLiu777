      <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
      <p>
        We want to focus on coffee shops in the greater Seattle area and provide
        a tool that allows you to compare coffee shops side by side and view
        accurate information about the details of each shop. A problem that is
        lacking in the coffee industry is that each website is specific to the
        coffee shop, there are no websites that include a variety of coffee
        shops. When looking at existing attempts to solve this problem, we
        found, for example, articles that list and rate coffee shops such as
        this website:
        <a
          href="https://seattle.eater.com/maps/essential-coffee-shops-seattle-cafes"
          alt="Coffee Shop Article"
          target="_blank"
          >Coffee Shop Article</a
        >
        Other than this, there are websites like Yelp that focus on food in
        general and donâ€™t allow you to compare shops to each other. We want to
        provide one page for users in Seattle to view these coffee shops and
        decide where to go based on their preferences.

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Individuals who consume coffee and reside in the Seattle metropolitan
          area will utilize the web application. These individuals will visit
          the website to learn about the Seattle coffee shop industry, compare
          coffee shops side-by-side, and obtain personalized recommendations. If
          the information presented is not comprehensive or if the
          recommendations are biased towards certain groups, the application
          could affect minority groups. Therefore, it is essential to ensure
          that the provided information is accurate, exhaustive, and impartial.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Users will be able to rate coffee shops, browse a variety of cafes,
          make purchases, contact coffee shops, and receive personalized
          recommendations. The application's interactive features will consist
          of a search function that filters coffee shops by location, price, and
          type, a rating system that enables users to rate coffee shops and
          leave reviews, and a recommendation system that suggests coffee shops
          based on the preferences of the user.
        </li>

        <li>
          At the current moment, we choose to sort data manually and then put
          them into a CSV file to use as the data source. Examples of the
          information will include, store name, location, time, URL, rating,
          detailed information, etc. We will also have some images for each of
          the stores that we use to place on our service. If in the future, we
          changed our mind to use API, we will update the section.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>No API at the moment.</li>
