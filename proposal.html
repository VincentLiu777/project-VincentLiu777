        <h2>Problem/Data Domain </h2>
        <p>We want to focus on coffee shops in the greater Seattle area and provide a tool that allows you to compare 
            coffee shops side by side and view accurate information about the details of each shop. A problem that is lacking
            in the coffee industry is that each website is specific to the coffee shop, there are no websites that include a 
            variety of coffee shops. When looking at existing attempts to solve this problem, we found, for example, 
            articles that list and rate coffee shops such as this website:  <a href="https://seattle.eater.com/maps/essential-coffee-shops-seattle-cafes" alt="Coffee Shop Article">Coffee Shop Article</a>
            Other than this, there are websites like Yelp that focus on food in general and donâ€™t allow you to compare shops to each other. 
            We want to provide one page for users in Seattle to view these coffee shops and decide where to go based on their preferences.
