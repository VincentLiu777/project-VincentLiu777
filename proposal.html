        <h2>Problem/Data Domain </h2>
        <p>We want to focus on coffee shops in the greater Seattle area and provide a tool that allows you to compare 
            coffee shops side by side and view accurate information about the details of each shop. A problem that is lacking
            in the coffee industry is that each website is specific to the coffee shop, there are no websites that include a 
            variety of coffee shops. When looking at existing attempts to solve this problem, we found, for example, 
            articles that list and rate coffee shops such as this website:  <a href="https://seattle.eater.com/maps/essential-coffee-shops-seattle-cafes" alt="Coffee Shop Article">Coffee Shop Article</a>
            Other than this, there are websites like Yelp that focus on food in general and donâ€™t allow you to compare shops to each other. 
            We want to provide one page for users in Seattle to view these coffee shops and decide where to go based on their preferences.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Individuals who consume coffee and reside in the Seattle metropolitan area will utilize the web application. 
                These individuals will visit the website to learn about the Seattle coffee shop industry, compare coffee shops 
                side-by-side, and obtain personalized recommendations. If the information presented is not comprehensive or if 
                the recommendations are biased towards certain groups, the application could affect minority groups. Therefore, 
                it is essential to ensure that the provided information is accurate, exhaustive, and impartial. </li>
            <li>Users will be able to rate coffee shops, browse a variety of cafes, make purchases, contact coffee shops, and 
                receive personalized recommendations. The application's interactive features will consist of a search function 
                that filters coffee shops by location, price, and type, a rating system that enables users to rate coffee shops 
                and leave reviews, and a recommendation system that suggests coffee shops based on the preferences of the user.</li>
